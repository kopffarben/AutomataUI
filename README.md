# AutomataUI for vvvv

Hello Automata UI !
this is a visual finite state machine editor with built in finite state machine.

This makes controlling your patch logic, scenes and behaviours a lot easier than using standard nodes like monoflop/flipflop/switch etc... Think of it like the "if then else" part of textual languages, but more visual.
